    "# Importance of Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling through standardization (or Z-score normalization)\n",
    "can be an important preprocessing step for many machine learning\n",
    "algorithms. Standardization involves rescaling the features such\n",
    "that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution\n",
    "with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many algorithms (such as SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic\n",
    "regression) require features to be normalized, intuitively we can\n",
    "think of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) as being a prime example\n",
    "of when normalization is important. In PCA we are interested in the\n",
    "components that maximize the variance. If one component (e.g. human\n",
    "height) varies less than another (e.g. weight) because of their\n",
    "respective scales (meters vs. kilos), PCA might determine that the\n",
    "direction of maximal variance more closely corresponds with the\n",
    "'weight' axis, if those features are not scaled. As a change in\n",
    "height of one meter can be considered much more important than the\n",
    "change in weight of one kilogram, this is clearly incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, PCA is performed comparing the use of data with\n",
    ":class:`StandardScaler <sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler>` applied,\n",
    "to unscaled data. The results are visualized and a clear difference noted.\n",
    "The 1st principal component in the unscaled set can be seen. It can be seen\n",
    "that feature #13 dominates the direction, being a whole two orders of\n",
    "magnitude above the other features. This is contrasted when observing\n",
    "the principal component for the scaled version of the data. In the scaled\n",
    "version, the orders of magnitude are roughly the same across all the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used is the Wine Dataset available at UCI. This dataset\n",
    "has continuous features that are heterogeneous in scale due to differing\n",
    "properties that they measure (i.e alcohol content, and malic acid).\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformed data is then used to train a naive Bayes classifier, and a\n",
    "clear difference in prediction accuracies is observed wherein the dataset\n",
    "which is scaled before PCA vastly outperforms the unscaled version.\n",
